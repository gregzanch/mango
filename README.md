# Mango Project

## Step 1

Use `django-admin startproject mango` to start a new django app.
Run `python3 manage.py runserver` to start the server and make sure everything works as expected.

## Step 2

Now we want to create a new `app` called `mangos`. 
> **NOTE**: `mangos` is the name of the app that holds the views, models, templates etc.
> `mango` is the name of base application that holds project level configuration. 

In order to do this we use `python3 manage.py startapp mangos`
